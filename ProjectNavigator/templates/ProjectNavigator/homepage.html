            <p>This is my first real Django project. I was first exposed to the Django framework as a required coding project for a class I was taking for fun,
            but I wanted to use it to do something more than the basic website we were asked to build. As out final "exam" for that class, we were
            told to just do something cool (awesome choice on behalf of the professor, shoutout to ProfJ), and I thought about combining the power of a website
            that can be accessed anywhere at any time by anyone, with a robotics project, and so the basic premise of the cheesit car was born. This project
            is just a website that generates a table, and updates the values in that table when the user clicks a button. Separately from the website, I also
            coded up a webscraper which could run on a rasberry pi and will look in that table for a change in values. Then, based on the values in the table,
            it will send commands to an arduino, which at the time, I had wired up to some basic motors and put into a cheesit box. Together, I had made a remote
            controlled vehicle that anyone could drive around my apartment from anywhere, dubbed the Cheesit Car. Got a solid A on that project.
