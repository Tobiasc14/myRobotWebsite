        The Mission:
    </h2>
    <div>
        <p>
        This controller was made by one person who wanted to make a phone controllable robot with a rasberry pi.
            There are no doubt easier ways, but the easiest way I knew how to do this was to use python and html
            to make a website, then make it publicly hosted so that the rasberry pi can use its internet connection
            to check the website to see if buttons were pressed by downloading and parsing the html. Yes, it's gross,
            yes it's impractical, but it worked! If you think you want to accept this challenge, then click
            the button below to move on.
